# PlayableAd
Playable ads are adverts that offer users interactive snippets of gameplay, otherwise known as “micro-games”, most commonly found in mobile games. These ads must be available instantaneously and have a low file size being developed in HTML5 and JavaScript.

This 6 level mini-game was made for NeonPlay as a playable demo to display my HTML and JS skills. It was based off their hyper-casual mobile game Buca, which can be found in the link below.
